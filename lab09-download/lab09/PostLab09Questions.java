     * individual flower in turn?
     * 
     * A: Yes, because the contents of the list do not matter.
     * B: No, you need to check each flower in the list to confirm it
     *    came from the correct island.
     * C: Yes, because the list is generic, and cannot contain anything
     *    except flowers because of the generic type parameter.
     * D: No, you need to check each flower in the list to make sure
     *    it is no longer on the island.
